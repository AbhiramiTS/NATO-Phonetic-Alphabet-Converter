# üöÅ NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This Python script converts a user-inputted word into its corresponding NATO Phonetic Alphabet representation. The NATO Phonetic Alphabet is a set of standardized phonetic substitutions used in radio communication for clarity in conveying letters.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the required library installed:

```bash
pip install pandas

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nato-phonetic-converter.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd nato-phonetic-converter
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python nato_converter.py
Enter a word when prompted, and the script will output the corresponding NATO Phonetic Alphabet representation.
Example
python
Copy code
import pandas

# Create a dictionary in this format: {"A": "Alfa", "B": "Bravo"}
data = pandas.read_csv("nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv")
phonetic_alpha_dict = {row.letter: row.code for index, row in data.iterrows()}

# Create a list of the phonetic code words from a word that the user inputs.
user_input = input()
phonetic_code = [phonetic_alpha_dict[char.upper()] for char in user_input if char.isalpha()]
print(phonetic_code)
Data Source
The script uses a CSV file, nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv, to create the initial dictionary mapping letters to their phonetic equivalents. Make sure the file is present and correctly formatted.
